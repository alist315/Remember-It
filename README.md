# Remember-It


## About
For this project I decided to create and application for people to store their favorite memories. Wether its your wedding, or a family vacation, this app is designed to help keep track of all of it. After you create an account you can add your favorite memories with some pictures and all the info on it.

## Approach
I started this project by thinking first what language to use for it, I chose angular for the simple fact I felt I haven't done angular justice and wanted to do something better. I have a main page with a login button that populates with a modal for users to login. After that you have a form to create your favorite memories!

I learned a new thing with angular called angular animate its a way to use css and angular to create animations its pretty simple but adds a nice touch to the user experience. I also used a new css framework called bulma.

This app also allows the user to edit their memories but clicking the update button, another form will populate and the user can edit or update any part of that particular memory.

## Technologies Used
- Angular
- MongoDB
- Node Js
- Bulma
- Heroku
- Git
- Express

##Improvements
I would have loved to find a way that the user could add more photos maybe a drop down menu that added their photos to a carousel. Also would have liked to make the site more responsive it is responsive but maybe just a hair cleaner. I would have loved to do an about me page just couldn't figure it out. Also my login works but i couldn't figure out how to make the information custom to the user account created.
